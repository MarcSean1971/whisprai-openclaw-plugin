# Security

ClawKit for WhisprAI pairs a user's local OpenClaw computer with WhisprAI. Treat installation like running local code.

## Security Model

- Pairing is explicit and revocable.
- The plugin polls WhisprAI from the user's computer; it does not require a public inbound tunnel to the computer.
- Relay and inbound secrets should be stored in OpenClaw plugin config.
- The plugin keeps temporary pairing data in memory and does not read or write a local pairing state file.
- Public status output masks secrets.
- Hosted WhisprAI should never expose OpenClaw gateway URLs or relay secrets to normal users.
- Sensitive local actions should remain protected by OpenClaw's normal approval flows.

## Command Execution Notice

This plugin intentionally uses Node's `child_process` API to launch the local OpenClaw executable:

```bash
openclaw agent --session-id whisprai:<conversation_id> --message <request> --json --timeout 600
```

This is the core bridge behavior. Marketplace scanners may flag the plugin because it executes a local command. That is expected. The plugin should only be installed by users who want WhisprAI to ask their own local OpenClaw agent to perform work.

By default the plugin launches `openclaw` from `PATH`. Users may optionally configure `openclawCommand` and `openclawArgsPrefix` in OpenClaw plugin config for custom launch environments. Do not point these settings at untrusted executables.

## What The Plugin Does Not Do

- It does not create a public tunnel to the user's OpenClaw gateway.
- It does not intentionally collect analytics.
- It does not intentionally send local files by itself.
- It does not read local files for pairing state.
- It does not bypass OpenClaw approval flows.
- It does not print relay tokens or inbound secrets in status output.
- It does not post internal `NO_REPLY` or JSON metadata as a visible Archie response.
